# 🌸 Perfume Store Website

This project is a front-end website for a perfume store, developed using **HTML** and **CSS** only.

It was created as my **first practical project** during my training with **SEF Academy**, with the aim of applying fundamental front-end concepts and building structured web pages.

## 📌 Project Description

The Perfume Store website presents a collection of perfumes with a clean and simple layout.
The project focuses on organizing content clearly and designing an attractive user interface without using any JavaScript or external libraries.
